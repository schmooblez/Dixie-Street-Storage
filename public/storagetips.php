			<li class="tips">You can save yourself some extra cash by renting an appropriately sized unit. Check out our <a href="sizeguide.html">size guide</a>.</li>

			<li class="tips">Start by gathering as many boxes that you think you will need, tape, markers and packing material (i.e. foam shipping noodles, bubble wrap, packing paper or towels).</li>

			<li class="tips">If possible, try to use uniform size boxes for easy stacking.</li>

			<li class="tips">Make up an inventory of your items and keep it in a safe place at home or in a safe deposit box away from the unit. Use our size guide to take inventory of your items and <a href="sizeguide.html">find out how much storage space you need</a>.</li>

			<li class="tips">Prepare your space by placing a protective cover on the floor under your goods.</li>

			<li class="tips">Place your storage items on 2 &times; 4 boards or on pallets to guard against dampness. Any concrete floor may become cold and damp.</li>

			<li class="tips">Plan your storage space. Place those items that you may need to access often in the front.</li>

			<li class="tips">CAUTION! Do not store anything COMBUSTIBLE (i.e., Paint thinner, gasoline, solvents, paint, etc.)</li>

			<li class="tips">Try to leave an aisle down the center of the storage unit for easier access. Leave a small space between the walls and boxes to allow for air circulation.</li>

			<li class="tips">Stack heavier boxes on the bottom and lighter boxes on top.</li>

			<li class="tips">Be sure your boxes are strong enough to hold 25&ndash;30 pounds (it is best not to put too much in each box).

			<li class="tips">List contents of boxes on all four sides; number the boxes and seal with tape.</li>

			<li class="tips">Dishes and glasses should be wrapped in paper and packed in sturdy boxes. Stack them on top.</li>

			<li class="tips">Pictures and mirrors should be wrapped in cardboard and marked &ldquo;FRAGILE&rdquo; and stacked on end.</li>

			<li class="tips">Furniture with drawers can be utilized as storage places for pictures, knick-knacks, china, silverware, small items, etc. Wrap them in tablecloths, towels or blankets to prevent breakage.</li>

			<li class="tips">Larger appliances make excellent &ldquo;packaging cases&rdquo; for blankets, towels, tablecloths and clothes.</li>

			<li class="tips">Put TV's and other electronics in the rear of your unit.</li>

			<li class="tips">Shovels, hoes, rakes and hoses can be stored together in empty trash cans. Stack extra cans inside each other.</li>

			<li class="tips">Tables that have removable legs should be broken down to save space.</li>

			<li class="tips">Sofas and love seats can be stored on end to save floor space. Wrap cushions in plastic and place on top of sofas.</li>

			<li class="tips">Avoid placing sharp or heavy objects on top of upholstered furniture.</li>

			<li class="tips">Cover stuffed furniture with cardboard or blankets to protect against dust.</li>

			<li class="tips">If you stand mattresses on their side, prop them up so they stand straight. They may tend to bend out of shape and become lumpy.</li>

			<li class="tips">Wipe any items made of metal; bikes, metal tables, tools, etc., with machine oil to prevent rusting.</li>
